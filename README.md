![](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-%20Apache%202.0-blue) ![]()

Powerflower is a lightweight software designed for power system power flow calculations, based on MATLAB. This tool provides researchers with the capability to perform power flow analysis effortlessly, supporting a format akin to PSASP, enabling both Newton iteration and PQ decomposition methods for conventional power system power flow calculations, and offering simple yet effective visualization of power flow results. 

## Overview
- Supports input with format similar to PSASP
- Choose 'Newton iteration' and 'PQ decomposition' algorithm to implement conventional power system power flow calculation
- Sisualization of power flow results in table and figure
- Batched calculation and analysis

## Documentation
For comprehensive instructions on installation, usage, and other details, please refer to the [Powerflower Documentation](doc/document.pdf).

## Note from the Author

Powerflower is a software project that I developed during my undergraduate studies, back when I was in my junior year. It was created as a learning experience and a personal project to explore power system analysis. While I've put effort into making it useful, please keep in mind that it may not have the sophistication of more mature software developed by seasoned professionals. I welcome feedback, contributions, and suggestions from the community to improve and enhance this tool.

Thank you for your interest in Powerflower, and I hope you find it valuable for your power system analysis endeavors.
